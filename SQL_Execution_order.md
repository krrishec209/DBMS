🔍 Understanding SQL Execution Order: A Key to Optimizing Queries 🔍
SQL is a powerful tool for managing and retrieving data from databases, but did you know that the order in which SQL operations are executed can impact performance and results?

Understanding the SQL execution order is essential for writing efficient queries and troubleshooting issues. Here's a quick breakdown:

1️⃣ FROM: The engine starts by identifying the tables or views in the query and gathering data from them.

2️⃣ JOIN: If the query includes JOINs, it combines data from multiple tables based on the given conditions.

3️⃣ WHERE: Filters the rows based on the conditions provided.

4️⃣ GROUP BY: Groups rows into summary rows based on a specified column(s).

5️⃣ HAVING: Filters the groups created by the GROUP BY clause.

6️⃣ SELECT: Determines which columns (or expressions) should be included in the output.

7️⃣ DISTINCT: Removes duplicate rows from the result.

8️⃣ ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.

9️⃣ LIMIT/OFFSET: Restricts the number of rows returned or skips a certain number of rows.
