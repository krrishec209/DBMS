Let me break down a pro-level SQL technique

SELECT

 department,

 employee_name,

 salary,



 FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
 PARTITION BY department
 ORDER BY salary
 ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
 ) AS department_lowest_salary,


 LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
 PARTITION BY department
 ORDER BY salary
 ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
 ) AS department_highest_salary



FROM employee_salaries;



By default, window functions like LAST_VALUE() have a tricky default frame that only looks backwards.


𝘓𝘦𝘵'𝘴 𝘣𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘬 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵'𝘴 𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨:

𝐔𝐍𝐁𝐎𝐔𝐍𝐃𝐄𝐃 𝐏𝐑𝐄𝐂𝐄𝐃𝐈𝐍𝐆: Starts at the first row of the partition
𝐔𝐍𝐁𝐎𝐔𝐍𝐃𝐄𝐃 𝐅𝐎𝐋𝐋𝐎𝐖𝐈𝐍𝐆: Goes all the way to the last row of the partition

This combination tells SQL: "𝘓𝘰𝘰𝘬 𝘢𝘵 𝘌𝘝𝘌𝘙𝘠 𝘳𝘰𝘸 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘥𝘦𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵, 𝘪𝘨𝘯𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘥𝘦𝘧𝘢𝘶𝘭𝘵 𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘨"

𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐚𝐮𝐥𝐭 𝐁𝐞𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐨𝐫 (🚫 𝐖𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐓𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐤):

-- This would only look backwards, missing true max
LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
 PARTITION BY department
 ORDER BY salary
) AS incorrect_max_salary


𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐓𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐤's (✅ 𝐖𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞):

LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
 PARTITION BY department
 ORDER BY salary
 ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
) AS true_department_max_salary

𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭:

1) Compute true department-wide min/max in ONE query
2) Avoid multiple passes through the data
3) Create fast, readable analytics

This works in Snowflake, BigQuery, and modern data warehouses. 

This gives you the ACTUAL department-wide min and max, not a limited window that can give misleading results.
